## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In order to keep the component looking similar in both mobile and desktop views, I used the aspect-ratio property to specify a desired shape, then used max-width to ensure that the window did grow past the desired size. 

I also encountered the issue of colors looking different on my monitors, so I made sure to check both the provided design and my own design on the same monitor to ensure they looked similar.

### Continued development

In terms of improving at styling, I'd like to get more comfortable using TailwindCSS to reproduce designs, as well as more advanced features such as style extensions. 

### Useful resources

- [mdn web docs - CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) - There were a few instances where I remembered what property I should use, but didn't remember its syntax. In those cases, it's best to look them up in the documentation.
